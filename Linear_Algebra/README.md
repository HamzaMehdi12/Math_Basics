## Linear Algebra
Here we implement the basics of Mathematics and functions that would be used in Machine Learning, and in general, in daily-life case

The functions implemented are as follows:
### Dot Product (def dot)
### Matrix Multiplication (def matmul) [Similar to dot]
### Inverse (def inverse)
### Eigen values and vectors (def eigen)
### Single Value Decompositon (def svd)
